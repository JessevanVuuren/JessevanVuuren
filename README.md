## About me


Hi there, I'm Jesse van Vuuren, a programmer who loves spending my free time building new projects. I've been coding since I was young, and my passion for programming has only grown stronger over the years.

Currently, I'm working on creating apps for both Android and iOS devices. I find the process of developing apps to be both challenging and rewarding, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills.

One of my proudest achievements is the creation of the "[Movie Recommender](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jesse.movieRecommender)" app, which has gained over 100,000 downloads on the Play Store. I worked hard to create an app that would provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their viewing history, and I'm thrilled that so many people have found it useful.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about programming, feel free to get in touch!
